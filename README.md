# My Setup
To run locally (ie instead of on AWS) create a conda environment and activate the environment (skip all the steps in the setup/ folder)
Then install /path-to-env/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
Also run `conda install h5py`


# Practical Deep Learning for Coders (fast.ai courses)



These are the lecture materials from [Practical Deep Learning for Coders](http://course.fast.ai/). Two important parts of the course are  [our online forums](http://forums.fast.ai/) and [our wiki](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/Main_Page).  If you are encountering an error, we recommend that you first search the forums and wiki for a solution.  If you can't find the answer there, the next step is to ask your question on the forums.  See this advice on [how to ask for help](http://wiki.fast.ai/index.php/How_to_ask_for_Help) in a way that will allow others to most quickly and effectively be able to help you.  Please don't use Github Issues to ask for help debugging (many questions have already been answered in the forums).
